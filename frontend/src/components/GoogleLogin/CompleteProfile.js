// PS:- Donot add a alert message( as shown in the video attached for reference) in completeProfile.js when the profile is completed as this can interfere with the testing environment.
import React from 'react'

export default function CompleteProfile() {
    return (
        <div>
            I am Complete Profile
        </div>
    )
}
