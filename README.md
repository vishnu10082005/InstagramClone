Overview
Milestone 30  focuses on implementing the frontend functionality for the created Google sign in buttons.


Frontend Test Cases
The following test cases have to get implemented and to get  passed:
[REQ072]_renders_CompleteProfile_form_with_username_input_and_submit_button
[REQ073]_submits_form_and_sends_correct_data

use `npm run test:serve` to run test cases

 
 PS:- Donot add a alert message( as shown in the video attached for reference) in completeProfile.js when the profile is completed as this can interfere with the testing environment.
